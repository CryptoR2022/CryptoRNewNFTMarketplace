                            Non-fungible tokens or NFTs are those digital assets
                            that symbolize real world objects like a piece of
                            music, art, videos, text, games or even software.
                            These NFTs are bought and sold online through
                            cryptocurrencies. Their encryption is almost on the
                            same lines of a cryptocurrency. These NFTs are
                            present in the market place since 2014 but it is of
                            late gaining attention of buyers and sellers in form
                            of digital arts. NFTs are mostly unique – one of its
                            own kind. These have unique identifying codes or
                            unique identifiers. NFTs exist on blockchains which
                            is a decentralized public ledger where all the
                            records relating to a particular NFT is maintained.
                            NFTs are non-fungible meaning that these are unique.
                            What does this mean? This means that NFTs cannot be
                            replaced with something else. Fungible items are
                            equal in value. For example a rupee is fungible. One
                            may exchange it for another one rupee anywhere in
                            Bharat. A Bitcoin is also fungible and can be traded
                            with another Bitcoin on the blockchain. Fungible
                            nature of cryptocurrencies makes it a trusted means
                            of conducting transaction on the blockchain. But one
                            cannot trade an NFT with some other NFT because both
                            of those will be unique and will be carrying
                            different values. Besides, NFTs cannot be traded in
                            fractions like Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
                            NFTs are bought and sold in its whole unit. One
                            cannot buy or sell a fraction of an artwork, a
                            music, a video or a game. This is one important
                            difference that NFTs have with their crypto assets
                            counterparts and that is the reason they have been
                            classified as non-fungible. NFTs have their own
                            digital signatures and that makes them unique. It
                            can be compared with an autographed or signed
                            artwork of an artist. Such physical objects will be
                            unique and so are these NFTs. Due to this unique
                            identifier every NFT is different and is one of its
                            own kind. This is the reason that they cannot be
                            exchanged or traded with any other NFT. We can
                            understand this from a real life example. The video
                            ‘Nyan Cat' was sold for almost 0.6 Million US
                            Dollars whereas another artwork ‘Everydays - The
                            First 5000 Days' was sold for 69 Million US Dollars.
                            Now, these two NFTs cannot be exchanged or traded
                            with one another, though both of them are NFTs.
                            Hence all NFTs are unique and non-fungible. Also, at
                            one point in time one NFT will have only one owner,
                            unless and until there are exceptions applied.

                            NFTs are created or minted from digital objects that
                            represent both tangible items as well as intangible
                            items. NFTs are similar to the physical collector's
                            items. The only difference is that these are in
                            digital form. NFTs provide exclusive ownership
                            rights that are verifiable on blockchain. Mostly,
                            NFTs will have only one owner at a time. Artists can
                            sign their artwork by including their signature in
                            the metadata of an NFT. The owner and creator of the
                            NFT can store all possible relevant information in
                            the NFT.<br />
                            Below is list of items that could be put under
                            NFT:-<br />

                            This list could be endless. You may think of
                            anything that can be converted into a digital form
                            and that can be your unique NFT. One may consider
                            converting one's marriage invitation card into an
                            NFT as well. There could be numerous examples by
                            which an NFT can be minted. As long as one is able
                            to find a customer or an appreciator for one's
                            digital work, each and every thing on this Earth is
                            a potential NFT. That is the power of NFT.

                            The use of any technology is in helping people.
                            Blockchain technology can be extended to help
                            artists and content creators in monetizing their
                            work. With the help of the technology artists may
                            interact with their customers and clients directly.
                            They no longer need to depend on auction houses and
                            art galleries. They can create, display and sell
                            their unique NFTs directly to the customers without
                            having any intermediary in-between. They may display
                            all the relevant information about their NFT and all
                            the records of the transactions will be recorded on
                            the decentralized ledger on the blockchain. The
                            creators get instant payment and they need not to
                            wait for an endless time following up for their
                            rightful money.<br />
                            NFTs can be stored as an asset that may have
                            potential to give higher returns on it with the
                            passage of time. The way one invests into gold,
                            stock market, mutual funds and cryptocurrencies for
                            higher returns in future; one may invest in NFTs
                            also in an anticipation of higher returns into
                            it.<br />
                            In fashion industry, a user or a potential customer
                            may have all the information related to any apparel,
                            if that apparel in on blockchain in form of an NFT.
                            Customer may know anything and everything from the
                            ownership information of the items to accessories
                            being offered with the item. Customer may know the
                            value addition done at every stage of the supply
                            chain and will be aware of the people behind it and
                            what is their contribution?<br />
                            Verification of licenses and certification such as
                            degrees or diplomas will be another use of NFTs.
                            This will save lot of time and will take away burden
                            from employees in checking, verifying and
                            maintaining such records in universities, colleges
                            and in other such institutions. By using NFT
                            functionalities on the blockchain the process will
                            be eased out and will be available for verification
                            on distributed ledger for everyone.<br />
                            The domain of advertising will witness lot of
                            changes. There will be no need of tracking people's
                            behaviour through social media. People will tell
                            their interest themselves on the blockchain and they
                            will be fed relevant information accordingly. It
                            will save lot of money that is being spent
                            unnecessarily on finding consumer inclination and
                            this money can be deployed for consumer benefit in a

                            Yes, you can convert your piece of music into an NFT
                            and can monetise the same. Music is considered to be
                            a wonderful collectable item for NFT lovers. Those
                            musicians who are aware of electronic music form a
                            wonderful NFT music community and are doing pretty
                            well for themselves. They are techno savvy and are
                            using technology in their music and are equally tech
                            savvy to convert their music into NFTs.<br />
                            You could be a singer, guitarist, pianist, drummer,
                            key board player or band owner; NFTs are for
                            everyone. The only qualification you should have is
                            that you should know to convert your music into
                            digital format and should be aware of some digital
                            mixing; your music NFT is ready to be uploaded on
                            our NFT platform. <br />
                            Music NFTs give you a chance to present your music
                            before people even if you are not connected to the
                            music world. Electronic music production is a boon
                            for such artists. NFT marketplace entitles you to
                            earn name, fame and wealth. All you need is the
                            faith in your music and you are through.<br />
                            When it comes to music NFTs, it is not the
                            prerogative of musicians and singers only. Any
                            common man can create his own music NFT. If you are
                            a poet and are good at reciting, just recite a few
                            lines of your poetry and convert that into NFT.
                            CryptoRNFT.Com is promoting what we term as 'NFT
                            Poetry'. You should select some good lines of your
                            poetry and should video-shoot it or make a video
                            with some graphics or other inputs to make an NFT
                            out of it. You may recite someone else's poetries
                            also, if you own the copyright of the same or it is
                            outside the purview of copyright.<br />
                            If you cannot find a suitable poem, you can read
                            short stories also with its graphical depiction on
                            the background to make it more attractive. If you
                            are not able to find out a short story, you can
                            choose some good quotes that you can convert into
                            NFT. What it means is that you should have an idea
                            with you to be converted into NFT, and that's it.<br />
                            In all, music NFTs are on growth path and they will
                            expand their wings in a year or two to scale new
                            heights. The way we see artworks flooded in NFT
                            marketplace, soon we will see half of the space
                            being captured by music NFTs. Indeed, it will be so

                            protocol, blockchain technology, smart contracts and

                            Here are some of the safety measures that you should
                            adopt to keep your NFTs safe.<br />
                            * You should not try to transfer your NFTs from a
                            wallet to another wallet that doesn't support your
                            NFTs token standards.<br />
                            * You may be a victim of a scam or fraud, so be
                            alert.<br />
                            * If you give malicious smart contract permission to
                            access your wallet, it may take away all your crypto
                            assets including your NFTs.<br />
                            * You should interact smart contracts of reputed
                            blockchain projects.<br />
                            * You should protect your wallet's mnemonic by
                            keeping it in a safe place after installing metamas.
                            k<br />
                            * You should carefully see all the rules of the
                            game, if you are playing one.<br />
                            * You should be careful that you do not delete,
                            intentionally or accidently, the assets in your
                            wallet.<br />
                            However, there are enough safety measures and
                            practices followed by various service providers so
                            that your chances of losing NFTs are minimal, but
                            yes the possibility always exists due to your own
                            mistake or due to some other reason. So, the saying
                            'prevention is better than cure', fits here.<br />

                            Digital wallets are those wallets that store digital
                            assets. Digital wallet can be defined as a software
                            programme that stores and allows transactions of
                            digital assets. These wallets are protected through
                            a private key and this key ensures ownership of the
                            crypto assets in the wallet to its owner.<br />
                            This private key allows the owner of the digital
                            wallet to access his digital assets. This key uses
                            sophisticated encryption and is integral part of
                            cryptocurrencies and its security makeup. It
                            consists of a series of alpha-numeric characters
                            that makes it very difficult for a hacker to
                            actually break it. This key is very crucial in
                            depositing and withdrawing crypto assets from the
                            digital wallets. Upon initiating a transfer from the
                            wallet, wallet software creates a digital signature
                            with this private key while processing the
                            transaction. This helps in maintaining the security
                            and in generating a valid signature. Even the
                            slightest of the alteration in the transaction will
                            change the digital signature that will cancel the
                            transaction and then a fresh validation will be
                            needed. It is extremely important that this private
                            key is kept secretly and safely. If one loses this
                            private key, one loses all his access to his crypto
                            assets.<br />
                            These wallets help in updating the transactions on
                            the blockchain's distributed ledger. Digital wallets
                            help in completing the creation, minting, purchase
                            and sale process of your NFTs and other crypto
                            assets very quickly and record them in real time.
                            Digital wallets make it easy to securely manage and
                            maintain one's crypto portfolio. Digital wallets can
                            be used to store all sort of crypto assets including
                            NFTs.<br />
                            Cryptocurrency is a high value target for hackers
                            and therefore it is important to store crypto assets
                            safely. You should choose a wallet based on your
                            requirements and you must handle it carefully to
                            prevent any loss of data. Wallets are stores of your
                            crypto assets to facilitate transactions and
                            therefore its proper maintenance and increased
                            awareness towards its security is a must.<br />
